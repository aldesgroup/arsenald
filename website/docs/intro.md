# Introduction

Welcome to the Arsenald documentation! Arsenald is a comprehensive full-stack development stack that combines several powerful tools:

- **Aldev**: Code assistance and development tools
- **Goald**: Go application server development
- **Goaldn**: React Native mobile development
- **Goaldr**: React web development

## What is Arsenald?

Arsenald is a unified development stack that provides a seamless experience for building modern applications. It combines the power of Go for backend services with React and React Native for frontend development, all enhanced by intelligent code assistance tools.

## Key Components

### Aldev
Code assistance and development tools that enhance your development workflow.

### Goald
Go-based application server that provides robust backend services.

### Goaldn
React Native framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

### Goaldr
React framework for building modern web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with Arsenald, you'll need to:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Install the necessary tools
3. Choose the components you want to use

Check out the specific documentation for each component to learn more about getting started.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
